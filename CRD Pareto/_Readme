Section 3.4 Example. 
Pareto frontier search for the completely randomized experiment example.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

"CRD_example_D.Rmd": the main R markdown for setting up, running the Pareto search,
                     obtaining the designs and their performances, for determinant-based criteria



"CRD_example_L.Rmd": the main R markdown for setting up, running the Pareto search,
                     obtaining the designs and their performances, for trace-based criteria


---------------------------------------------------------------------


1. We have created the output only for the determinant-based criteria, however, the code is there to be run for the trace-based ones as well.


2. Number of random starts (Nstarts), tau2 (tau2) can be changed in the "Setting parameters" block of the script file.


2. "output\tables" contains tables with design labels and their eficiency values, ordered with respect to different weight allocations.



The "_summary.xlsx" files have been compiled manually to display a few top designs from each of the weight combinations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------


\functions: contains script files with the functions used for search and design evaluation
\output: R workspace files and tables with design properties generated in the main script
