Section 3.4 Example. 
Assessing Generalized D- and L-optimal designs in terms of MSE(DP)- and MSE(LP)-criteria for the completely randomized experiment example.



1. R script titled "Figure_5_GD_GL.R":

The figure can be generated from the pre-calculated tables of designs' criteria values (default option), or the search can be run first by calling the "<...>_main.R" scripts -- this option is specified within the Figure script, the lines that runs the scripts can be just un-commented. The "<...>_main.R" scripts can be run in parallel as well.

The figure is saved in the "output/" folder.


2. If it is desirable to change the number of random starts -- this can be done in the "<..>_main.R" scripts, by changing the variable "Nstarts". 


3. Each "<...>_main.R" script creates an output file with the tables of designs' efficiency values and R workspace, saved in the corresponding folders within the "output/" folder.



4. The "\functions" folder contains script files with the functions used for search and design evaluation:


  "Common.functions.R": functions that are common for all criteria
  "GD_functions.R": criteria and search functions for the Generalized D-criterion
  "GL_functions.R": criteria and search functions for the Generalized L-criterion
  "Criteria_evaluation.R": functions for design evaluation, all criteria
